# Tailwind Css (Mobile First)


-> Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to quickly and
easily build custom styles for your website or web application. It is based on 
the principle of "atomic design," which means that your styles are built up from 
small, reusable components. This makes it easy to maintain your styles and to make
changes as needed.
Tailwind CSS comes with a large number of pre-defined utility classes that you 
can use to style your elements. These classes cover a wide range of properties, 
including colors, borders, shadows, and more. You can also use Tailwind CSS to 
create your own custom classes.
To use Tailwind CSS, you simply need to include the Tailwind CSS stylesheet in 
your project. You can then use the Tailwind CSS classes in your HTML markup
